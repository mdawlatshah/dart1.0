**Dart Data Types**
- Numbers
    - Integer (values without a decimal point)
    - Double (values with decimal points)
- Strings (sequence of characters)
- Booleans (true/false values)
- Collection of Objects
    - Lists (ordered group of objects)
    - Maps (set of values as key-value pairs)

**Dynamic Type**
If the type of a variable isn't defined, the variable's type is *dynamic*.

**Variable**
a named space in the memory, variables store a reference to the value. 
- can have alphabets and numbers
- cannot be keywords (reserved)
- cannot begin with a number
- cannot contain spaces or special characters except (_) and ($).

var         name        =   'Katherine';
data type   identifier      value

**Dart considers all values as objects, therefore variables which are not initialized have value of null.**
